                  Ramblewood EC4-604 Downdraft Cooktop is the fact that it does not have a quick-heating component
                  like the other two cited above.</li>
               <li>However, what sets it apart is that it may offer higher temperatures and will let you cook in a
                  vast selection of temperatures that you could select with precision. This electric cooktop with
                  a downdraft port will last you a very long time because of the strong build. It may just be the
                  ideal option.</li>
